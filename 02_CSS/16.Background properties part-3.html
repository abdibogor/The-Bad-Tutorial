	   <h1>Argentina</h1>
	   <p>Argentina Listen, Officially the Argentina Republic (spanish, Republica Argentina is a federal republic located in southeastern South America. Sharing the Southern Cone With its smaller neighbour Chile) The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[21] The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.[22] Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata,[23] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook. The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest nation in the world by the early 20th century.[24][25]

Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into underdevelopment,[26] though it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several decades.[24] Following the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his wife Isabel Martínez de Perón ascended to the presidency. She was overthrown in 1976 by a U.S.-backed coup which installed a right-wing military dictatorship. The military government persecuted and murdered numerous political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism that lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as President in 1983. Several of the junta's leaders were later convicted of their crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.

Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power[27] in international affairs, and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America.[28][29] Argentina has the second largest economy in South America, the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States. It is the country with the second highest Human Development Index in Latin America with a rating of "very high".[30] Because of its stability, market size and growing high-tech sector,[31] Argentina is classified as a high-income economy in the 2019 fiscal year.[32]
